### What is fishily? 
Fishily is an app built for local fishermen/women to find and share their favorite fishing spots! 

Upon landing on the "home" page, users will be met with a short introduction into what the app's purpose is. There will be a button prompting them to sign in if they don't have an account. 

 * If they are logged in, this will redirect them to the "index" page, which will show a google map showing fishing spot pins.

 * Users can view their profile, and make changes to their info as well. 

On Fishily, users can: 
* create an account, with their username, name, and password.
* The Primary purpose of the app is for users to create posts.
    * posts will have titles, descriptions, the fish caught, location, and optionally an image,and date/time.
    * (FUTURE FEATURE) : When creating a post, users can set a pin on a map (using google maps API) to show others (roughly) where they caught their delicious fish!
    * STRETCH GOAL: Users will also be able to leave comments on other users posts.
    * Users will have full CRUD capability on their posts and comments.

* (FUTURE FEATURE) : users will also be able to look at our fish database, to search up any info on a fish they're interested in looking for. 
    * this database will have a fishes' name, genus, species, a short bio, and an image!

*  (FUTURE FEATURE) : Fishily will connect to the fishbase API, an external API that contains thousands of records of detailed fish info.
